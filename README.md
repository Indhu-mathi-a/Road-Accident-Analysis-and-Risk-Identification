# Road Accident Analysis and Risk Identification

## Overview

Road accidents pose a serious challenge to public safety, resulting in loss of life, injuries, and economic damage. Understanding accident patterns and identifying high-risk conditions are essential for improving road safety.

This project analyzes road accident data using Python to identify key accident causes, study accident trends, and classify accidents into risk levels based on driving conditions. The insights are presented using data visualizations and a dashboard-style layout for clear interpretation.

## Objectives

* To analyze road accident data using Python
* To identify major causes of road accidents
* To visualize accident trends using charts and graphs
* To study the impact of speed, alcohol involvement, and weather conditions
* To classify accidents into Low, Medium, and High Risk categories
* To present insights using a professional dashboard design

---

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* CSV Dataset
* Power BI (Dashboard Concept)

---

## Methodology

1. Load and preprocess the accident dataset using Pandas
2. Perform exploratory data analysis to identify accident patterns
3. Visualize accident data using pie charts, bar charts, and line graphs
4. Apply rule-based logic to classify accident risk levels
5. Present insights through a structured and professional dashboard

## Risk Level Classification

Accidents are classified based on driving conditions using the following logic:

* **High Risk:** High speed with alcohol involvement
* **Medium Risk:** Moderate speed conditions
* **Low Risk:** Low speed and no alcohol involvement

This classification helps in identifying dangerous driving scenarios.

## Dashboard Description

The dashboard provides a clear visual overview of:

* Accident causes distribution
* Risk level ratios
* State-wise accident analysis
* Weather-based accident trends
* Speed versus accident severity
* Rural and urban accident comparison
